DESCRIPTION

    Kunagi is a free web-based tool for integrated project management and
    collaboration based on Scrum. It is integrated, as it aims to allow
    users to manage their complete project using only one tool. For that
    purpose, Scrum was supplemented by a selection of other best practices
    to cover all project management needs. The tool's range provides not only
    the basis for all Scrum practices (like product, sprint backlogs and
    impediment list), but also offers management of additional important
    project data (like non-functional requirements, risks, files, issues and
    bugs) as well as several functionalities for the ease of use (featuring a
    project dashboard, interactive whiteboard for the current sprint and
    planning poker for estimation) and team collaboration (including comments
    for every entity and a discussion board).

    Kunagi aims for, but is not limited to, software projects. The light
    nature of agile project management allows for use by professionals as well
    as non-professionals causing minimal overhead to the project. Therefore,
    it is also suitable for small projects done by virtual teams, i. e. teams
    that are scattered across the world.

    Using Kunagi's web interface it is possible to access project related data
    from everywhere. Although being an online application, the powerful
    interface is built to keep up with the flexibility of desktop
    applications, as it makes use of asynchronous technology employing the
    Google Web Toolkit (GWT).

    Last, but not least, it is important to us that the tool helps people get
    their work done. We understand that it is therefore important for the tool
    to be not only suitable for project management, but furthermore to be
    accessible, offer a coherent work flow and be fun to use. For this reason,
    we have been using Kunagi for it's own project management since it was
    ready to provide sufficient functionality for our needs. Moreover, after
    the tool's release, we will provide additions, enhancements and updates to
    it on a regular basis.
